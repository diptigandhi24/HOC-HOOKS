So we have four buttons which on click displays the alert box.
I started by creating a button component, which returns four buttons
-----CSS Part------
There are somestyles which are common and some style which are not.
1. Common styles: width, height, font-size, border-radius, border-color. 
2. Uncommon styles: background-color, button text.

To solve this,
we created "btn" class where we kept all the common styles.
Then, we created four more classes in button.css
"btn-primary" "btn-secondary" "btn-success" "btn-warning"
The reason for creating four classes, if you want to add more styling to any
particular button then you can add those styling simply in that class.
e.g btn-success{
    background-color: green;
    color:red;
}

**Note: Its interesting to see how we think about the separation in css.
How easily we can change the style of one button without affecting other

-----CSS Part------

----- CODE QUALITY TILL NOW--------
1. Avoid repitation in your code
2. Keep your code flexible, avoid hardcoding 


----- CODE QUALITY TILL NOW--------
 
----QUALITY CHECK---------
Understand Repitation:
Creating button is a task,
We have four buttons, we have wrote the code fourtimes for that
Understanding what part of that task is common and What part is not common,
Inside our Button apart from background-color and button-text all otherstyles are same.
Till now, we have hardcoded button styles.
Lets make our code flexible, how?
We will create a button with all the common task and will also let user add the
style during the creation of button
We will create a Task, which returns the button
Whenever we want to create a button we will call this task.
Task will have all the common-style hardcoded init
Task will allow user to add style during the creation of button
and it will return a button as developer wants
